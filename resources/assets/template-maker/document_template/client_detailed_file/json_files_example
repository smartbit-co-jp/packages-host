- GroupName {
	type -> Group with its ATTRIBUTES relationships
	label -> to be displayed	
	attributes -> List of attributes that will be shown within this group
		{
			type ->
		}
}


Types = [
	'group', -> Creates a different container to show the attributes list related to the group
		** Usually on the first level deep inside the config file.
		label: Required because it will become the card's title label which usually loads collapsible
		key: Not necessary as this the main objetice of this type "group" is to create a separation between other lists, and it might not necessarily be related to a model itself


	'model' -> Used to assimilate the list attributes to a model's property, to later dynamically render the values from the database on the rendered document
		** Usually a few levels deep inside the config file, but CAN also be on the first level and act as a group on the list of variables
		label: Optional, when the user wants to create a clear separation between different models attribute inside the same GROUP list
		key: 

	'attribute' -> Possesses information regarding where to retrieve the data from the model 
		label: Required when listing the model's attribute label to be used on the template






	/// Example of Attribute type
	It will contain information regarding the model's property/attribute that will be listed/used for the template

	attribute -> Differentiates from the type to retrieve the needed information to render and proccess with dynamic information

	label -> The label that will be used when displaying the list of attributes to use on the template

	key -> used on a dot notation to access the model's property

		ex.: client.name, client.addresses.zipcode, company.name, company.registry_code
		ex. on the template: @client.name, @client.address.zipcode, @company.name, @company.registry_code
	format -> Can be used to format and display information if needed, like on phone numbers, formatation of numbers or other types of information
	Ex.:
	"name":{
		"type":"attribute",
		"key":"client.name",
		"label":"Client's Name"
	}


	// Example of Model type
	It contains information regarding the MODEL itself, containing possibly multiples attributes related to the model
   
	Ex.:
	"department":{
		"type":"model",
		"class":"App\\Models\\Company\\Department",
		"attributes":{
			"name":{"type":"attribute","key":"company.department.name","label":"Departname's Name/Title"}
			"director":{"type":"attribute","key":"company.department.director","label":"Departname's Director"},
			Consult Attribute type above for more examples
